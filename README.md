## Introduction

[website](http://norvig.com/sudoku.html) where
I began looking into solving the sudoku problem.


### Size

I don't think my combination calculation is completely correct but I believe I
can use it for a baseline in problem scope for comparison. After adding in some
more block logic we saw the following.

pre-change:
    1,741,753,256,863,334,400,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

post-change:
    462,838,344,192,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

A decrease in the scope of the problem by a magnitude of 4. That is 0.0267% of
the original size of the problem.
